## Deployment

1. [Authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_auth) - follow the guide, you need an active AWS access portal session for the AWS CDK.
2. [Bootstrapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_bootstrap) - deploying stacks with the AWS CDK requires dedicated Amazon S3 buckets and other containers to be available to AWS CloudFormation during deployment.

After, you should be available to deploy.

- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with the current state

## Be Aware

In the core of the project, you'll find `cdk.context.json` - highly recommended to fill it in case of production usage :)
